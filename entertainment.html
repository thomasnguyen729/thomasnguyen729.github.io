The Stereotypes Within Stereotypes <br> <br>

	“I am done with life” said the girl. “Everyday I go to school, I am body shamed by people, even those I considered my friends. They think I wish to look like this!” said the girl now sobbing. These pathetic standards for women have been implemented throughout society for ages across the world due to man’s malicious thoughts that women should look a certain way. Unfortunately, this results in women being crippled if they do not fill these “standards” and which caused them to attempt which results in their  real identity being tarnished. However, thanks to effective women's movements, women have been granted their rightful rights slowly, though these stereotypes have yet to be terminated. This is explicitly seen in Barbie ads throughout these past few decades which have adjusted as a result of the more freedom given to women, but are still crawling with society’s judging persona.  Although both the game designer barbie advertisement and the poem “Barbie Doll” by Marge Piercy both communicate the stereotypical nature of society, “Barbie Doll” however illustrates the devastating sexist harm against women in a more conservative society, while the game designer barbie ad attempts to conform to the equalizer norms as seen their various tones. <br> <br>
	The detrimental sexism against women is seen in Piercy’s “Barbie Doll” atrocious tone to communicate society’s traditional and barbaric actions against women, unlike the Barbie game designer ad. For example, Piercy opens the poem by depicting a scene of a young and innocent girl who was navigating life but then is judged by her physical being by malicious people. She tries everything to adjust to their image such as cutting her body parts, but she ends up killing her identity when she fully becomes societies robotic-like image. “In the casket displayed on satin she lay with the undertaker’s cosmetics painted on, a turned up putty nose, dressed in pink and white nightie. Doesn’t she look pretty? Everyone said. Consummation at last” (Piercy 404). This frightening scene illustrates the girl’s demise after adjusting to society’s stereotypes that “women should be a pretty face to look at” (eye candy). Words such as “undertakers” and “putty” communicate this detrimental image and are done to show that the culprit behind these bloody scenes is society’s judging persona. Society cripples women in a heartless and egotistical way that it does not allow women to have any freedoms expect to just exist and look pretty, simply because men are seen as superior than women due to them looking “weaker”. Thus society’s stereotypical nature is established as women are shamed upon in a dictating approach if they do not fill their unfair expectations which results in their ultimate demise. Thankfully, this conservative approach will be eliminated in the Barbie game designer ad years later, though society’s stereotypical nature will continue thriving within it.  <br> <br>
Moreover, the game designer Barbie product widens its audience by adhering to the inherent gender stereotypes placed by men on women. As game designing has mostly been dominated by men, this barbie doll acts as a catalysts for empowering women to explore passions that have not been traditionally held by women. With this new game designer themed Barbie product, game development will rise in popularity as a possible lucrative career path for young ambitious girls. Game Designer Barbie plays well to its audience of young girls by addressing the subject of game design with the color background with miscellaneous snippets of Javascript code as well as through the use of mostly pink graphics on the computer screen used by Barbie. Barbie’s marketing to this very narrow audience is helping to establish the legitimacy of girls working in the gaming development workforce while sticking true to the inherently sexist model of pink. The color pink is “girly” because it has been established by society to be associated with girls for such a long time. The facial expressions of Barbie in the advertisement depicts her as in deep intelligent thought. Although Barbie’s unrealistic physical size and exotic hair color detract from the overall message of the advertisement, the sales pitch of a woman working on game development helps the popular ideal that women should be granted equal freedom and luxuries as men. This is effective because society is receptive to these stereotypes on young women and continues communicating the judging persona of society. <br> <br>
While both Piercy’s Barbie Doll and the game designer ad both convey various tones, they simultaneously establish the overwhelmingly judging persona of society as communicated with their labeling adjustments on women. For example, as stated earlier, Piercy’s Barbie Doll poem displays a dictating approach toward women, illustrated through its brutal tone, as it seemingly denies women any luxuries to be free from any generalizations and instead, puts them in a stereotype box they can not escape. They are shamed for not fitting society’s wish that they should be pretty and do nothing instead of allowing women to be something else than eye candy. While the Barbie game designer ad “eliminates” this stereotypical box as it allows women more roles in society, it still generalizes them as their working equipment and hair are connected to the feminism of the past. The Barbie’s equipment is pink, a color society glorifies and labels as “girly” while her hair is that of a modern and neat style, communicating that women should pay more attention to their looks. In both instances, women are stereotyped in vicious ways as no matter how much limitations or freedom that they have, ones malevolent society finds a way to stereotype them in any environment. <br> <br>
	Furthermore, while both Piercy’s Barbie Doll poem and the Barbie Game Designer Ad display the immense prejudice against women in society due to their use of a sexiest tone, however though, Piercy’s Barbie Doll poem illustrates a bloodier reality for women while the Barbie Game Designer Ad communicates a slightly more just society. <br> <br>
